# Hack-A-Vcon Best Detection and Best Reduction of Vcons files

## HACK-A-VCON


The goal of data minimization, a privacy and data protection philosophy, is to only gather, process, and keep personal data as long as it is absolutely required for that purpose. 
The tenet of data minimization is that organizations shouldn't gather or hold onto more personal information than is necessary to fulfill their legal obligations.
Instead, they should only gather, use, and retain the bare minimum of information.

I have done both challenges :
Best Redaction: Take the series of vCons and remove all the personal identifiable information. 
Best Detection:Â Take the series of vCons, and list all the personal identifiable information. 


# Best Redaction Output resuts:


# Best Detection Output results:
